# TelegramBot
It's just a pet-project where I realizaed a bot for telegram by using aiogram.

As a client of that bot, you can get the general information about cafe or restaurant, who administrates that bot.
After it every client can look throw menu and make order by using inline butons nex to every meal.
In conclusion you might specify the address of delivery and the only thing you have to do after all these operations
is waiting for your order.

As a admin, you can manage menu of your restaurant and change every single element in it,
but previously you have to confrim autentification by password, which nows only administrator.
